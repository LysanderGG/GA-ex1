# GA-ex1
An Introduction to Genetical Algorithms - exercise 1

First exercise of the book _An Introduction to Genetical Algorithms_ (http://www.boente.eti.br/fuzzy/ebook-fuzzy-mitchell.pdf)

Implement a simple GA with fitness−proportionate selection, roulettewheel sampling, population size
100, single−point crossover rate pc = 0.7, and bitwise mutation rate pm = 0.001. Try it on the
following fitness function: ƒ(x) = number of ones in x, where x is a chromosome of length 20.
Perform 20 runs, and measure the average generation at which the string of all ones is discovered.
Perform the same experiment with crossover turned off (i.e., pc = 0). Do similar experiments, varying
the mutation and crossover rates, to see how the variations affect the average time required for the GA
to find the optimal string. If it turns out that mutation with crossover is better than mutation alone,
why is that the case?
